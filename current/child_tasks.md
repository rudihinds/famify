# Task Completion Workflow - Development Scope

## Overview

This feature represents the core daily interaction of the Famify app - the workflow where children complete tasks, parents review and approve them, and FAMCOINS are awarded. This is the primary value delivery mechanism that transforms the sequence/group/task architecture into actual daily family routines.

## Phase 1: Child Task Interface

### Daily Task List Screen

Build the main child interface where children see their tasks for any given day. This screen needs to:

- Display all tasks assigned to the current child for the selected date
- Show task information including name, group context, FAMCOIN value, and completion status
- Filter tasks based on group active days (only show tasks from groups that are active for the current day of week)
- Handle empty states when no tasks are scheduled for a particular day
- Include visual indicators showing which tasks require photo proof
- Show completion status with clear visual hierarchy (pending, completed awaiting approval, approved, rejected)
- Provide date navigation allowing children to see tasks for different days
- Display the child's current FAMCOIN balance prominently

### Task Completion Action

Implement the core interaction where children mark tasks as complete:

- Add completion toggle/button for each pending task
- Trigger immediate optimistic UI update showing task as "completed, awaiting approval"
- Handle the optional photo capture flow when tasks require photo proof
- Store completion timestamp and update task status in the database
- Queue actions for offline sync when network is unavailable
- Provide immediate visual feedback with loading states during submission

### Photo Capture System
