# Test Suite Summary

## Current Status
- **Total Test Files**: 15
- **Total Tests**: 95
- **Passing Tests**: 25 (26%)
- **Failing Tests**: 67 (71%)
- **Skipped Tests**: 3 (3%)

## Completed Work

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Created comprehensive mock factories for all data models
- ✅ Set up test helpers with Redux Provider wrapper
- ✅ Configured Jest with proper React Native and Expo mocks
- ✅ Fixed React Native reanimated version mismatch

### 2. Bug Fixes During Testing
- ✅ Fixed QRCodeGenerator bug: `data` → `childData` reference error
- ✅ Fixed Alert import in Scanner component
- ✅ Added dev mode support to Scanner for testing
- ✅ Created missing development config utilities

### 3. Test Suites Written

#### Child Task List (`__tests__/child/taskList.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Basic rendering tests passing
- ✅ Empty state tests passing
- ⚠️ 3 tests skipped (accordion interactions)
- Status: 9/12 passing (75%)

#### QR Authentication (`__tests__/child/qrAuth.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Child profile creation tests
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Dev mode scanner tests
- ⚠️ Button validation test needs fixing
- ⚠️ Alert mock issue in one test
- Status: 7/10 passing (70%)

#### Other Test Suites Created But Need Work
- PIN Authentication tests
- Profile Setup tests
- Session Management tests
- Task Completion tests
- Photo Capture tests
- Parent Review tests

## Key Issues to Address

### 1. Mock Issues
- Many tests fail due to missing component mocks
- Alert.alert needs proper mocking
- Some Redux thunk actions need better mocking

### 2. Component Issues
- PIN screens use custom keypads, not TextInput
- Many components rely on navigation params
- Async state updates need proper `act()` wrapping

### 3. Test Quality Improvements Needed
- Tests should verify expected behavior, not just match current implementation
- Need more edge case testing
- Should test error states and loading states
- Integration tests between parent/child flows

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Critical Mocks First**: Update jest-setup.js with all missing mocks
2. **Focus on High-Value Tests**: Prioritize auth flow and task completion
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows like task creation → completion → review
4. **Improve Test Data**: Use more realistic test scenarios
5. **Add E2E Tests**: Consider Detox or similar for end-to-end testing

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining mock issues in jest-setup.js
2. Complete PIN authentication tests with proper keypad interactions
3. Write FAMCOIN transaction tests
4. Add service layer tests for business logic
5. Create integration tests for critical user journeys
